Created Tesla Home Page Clone website using following web technologies

1) HTML 
2) CSS

4) React JS

HTML - Defines the meaning and structure of the web content(Skeleton of the website)

CSS - To alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative feature

JavaScript - Adding behavior to the website

React JS - Used for handling the view layer for web application. It also allows us to create reusable UI components and allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. 

Redux JS - It is a state management tool with React and helps to write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments and are easy to test. The state of your application is kept in a store, and each component can access any state that it needs from this store.

Material UI - It is a component library for React teeming with powerful components that should be using in the projects.  Material UI can provide you with solid pre-styled components that will get the job done. in this project, I used it for the close button, burger button on the home page of Tesla.
